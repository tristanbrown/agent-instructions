# <Feature or Module Name> – Implementation Plan V1 
<across attempts, increment the version number in the header and filename>

## Strategy

Summarize this plan in a few sentences, explaining what is unique about it. Be specific about key objects/classes!

## Outline

**Stage 1:** Short, 1-line summary.
**Stage 2:** Short, 1-line summary.
...
**Stage N:** Short, 1-line summary.

## Stage 1. <Descriptive Name>

**Goal:** What this stage accomplishes in the project.

**Scope:**
- Short bullet list of the concepts that are implemented in this stage.

**Implementation Decisions:**
- Bullet list of the key, high-level technical and architectural choices.
- Name key objects/classes, their role, and how they are represented.
- Make concrete decisions about *concepts* and *technologies*, but don't constrain implementation!
- Don't clutter things up with pseudocode, parameter or field names, or type hints.
- Stay as concise and brief as possible!

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Bullet list, in natural language, of the observable outcomes or behaviors that I, the human developer, need to manually test and evaluate.
- Be specific!
- Still no pseudocode.
