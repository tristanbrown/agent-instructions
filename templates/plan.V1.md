## Stage 1. <Descriptive Name>

**Goal:** What this stage accomplishes in the project.

**Scope:**
- Bullet list of what concepts are implemented in this stage.
- Name key objects/classes, and describe their purpose, and how they relate to each other and the larger plan.
- Don't clutter things up with pseudocode, variable or field names, or type hints.

**Implementation Decisions:**
- Bullet list of the key, high-level technical and architectural choices.
- Make concrete decisions. No hand-waving!
- Still don't need pseudocode clutter.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Bullet list, in natural language, of the observable outcomes or behaviors that I, the human developer, need to manually test and evaluate.
- Still no pseudocode.
